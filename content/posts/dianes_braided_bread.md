My mother-in-law entrusted me with her braided bread recipe during the early parts of the COVID pandemic. I've since made some minor tweaks to make it stay fresh for longer, including using a [yudane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangzhong).

## Ingredients

#### Yudane
* 125g all-purpose flour
* 125g water, boiling

#### Main Dough
* 500g all-purpose flour
* 170g water, warm (approx. 100 degrees F)
* 12.5g salt
* 11.25g active dry yeast
* 76g butter
* 62.5g sugar
* 2 large eggs (approx. 112g)

#### Egg Wash & Decoration
* 1 egg, well beaten
* 1 tbsp water
* Sesame seeds (optional)

## Process

__Make the yudane:__ Combine 125g flour and 125g boiling water in a heat-proof bowl. Stir until no dry flour remains, then let cool.

__Bloom the yeast:__ Combine the remaining 170g water and the yeast. Let stand for 10 minutes; the mixture should be frothy.

__Start the dough:__ Whisk together remaning flour, sugar, and salt in a stand mixer bowl. Add the cooled yudane to the bowl as well. With the dough hook attached & mixer running at medium-low speed, add the eggs then water/yeast mixture. Let the dough come together until no dry flour remains.

__Add the butter & knead:__ While the mixer is running at medium-low speed, add the butter a tablespoon at a time. Be sure to let each addition of butter integrate into the dough before adding the next. Once all the butter is integrated, raise the mixer speed slightly and knead for 7-10 minutes, or until the dough resists tearing when pulled.

__Overnight bulk fermentation:__ Roll the dough into a tight ball, then place into a greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise overnight in the refrigerator. Optionally, let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled.

__Braiding:__ Divide the dough in half; each half will yield one loaf. Divide each of these into thirds, then roll into long strands. Braid the strands together[^1]. Repeat with the other half of the dough.

__Proof and egg wash:__ Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Cover the loaves with a tea towel and let rise for 60-90 minutes[^2], or until nearly doubled in size. Spread the egg wash over the surface of the loaves in an even layer, then add the sesame seeds if using.

__Bake:__ Bake the loaves for 20-25 minutes, rotating at the 10 minute mark. The loaves should be well-browned & glossy, with an internal temperature of approx. 190 degrees F. Let the loaves rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
