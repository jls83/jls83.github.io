## About Me
I'm a Software Engineer based in the NYC Metro Area (specifically [North Bellmore, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bellmore,_New_York)). I am currently employed at [Google](https://www.google.com) on the [Ads Explanations team](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9000655?hl=en). Previously I worked as an Engineering Team Lead at [YCharts](https://ycharts.com), a research platform for financial decision makers.

My current primary working languages are C++ and Dart, however I love working in Python most of all. I also have experience with C#, Clojure/ClojureScript, Rust, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and Powershell. Neovim is my editor of choice, though I will occassionally will use JetBrains IDEs, including the amazing IdeaVim plugin.

In my free time I am a musician, playing guitar and bass for various bands in the NY area. Check out some of them below!

* [Rice Cultivation Society](https://ricecultivationsociety.bandcamp.com/) _(inactive)_
