## About Me
I'm a __Engineering Team Lead__ based in the NYC Metro Area (specifically [Lynbrook, NY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynbrook,_New_York)). I am currently employed at [YCharts](https://ycharts.com), a research platform for financial decision makers.

I love working in Python, and lately (thanks to ES6) have warmed up to working in JavaScript. We're beginning to work with Angular 9 and TypeScript at YCharts as well, and I'm super excited to get static types on the frontend. I also have experience with C#, Clojure/Clojurescript, Go, Powershell, and Rust. Vim is my editor of choice, though I will occassionally will use JetBrains IDEs, including the amazing IdeaVim plugin.

In my free time I am a musician, playing guitar and bass for various bands in the NY area. Check out some of them below!

* [Sick Sticks](http://sicksticksband.com/)
* [Rice Cultivation Society](https://ricecultivationsociety.bandcamp.com/) _(inactive)_
